# Authorize Apparatus

A secure authorization and access management infrastructure powered by Stacks blockchain. This decentralized system provides robust mechanisms for managing permissions, tracking activities, and ensuring secure transactions across various digital platforms.

## Smart Contract Infrastructure

The platform is built on four core smart contracts that work together to create a secure and transparent authorization ecosystem:

### Access Control Contract
The central contract that manages permissions, roles, and access rights. Key features include:
- Dynamic role-based access management
- Granular permission definition
- Secure access token generation
- Activity logging and tracking
- Emergency access revocation

### Activity Monitor Contract
Implements advanced tracking and logging mechanisms:
- Real-time activity tracking
- User action monitoring
- Permission change logging
- Anomaly detection algorithms
- Comprehensive audit trail generation

### Trust Manager Contract
Manages user trust and authorization reputation:
- Trust score calculation
- Permission elevation mechanisms
- Risk-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Reputation-driven authorization rules

### Transaction Handler Contract
Handles secure transaction processing and verification:
- Cryptographically secure transaction validation
- Multi-signature authorization
- Token-based authentication
- Secure state transition management
- Advanced replay protection

## Core Features

- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Precise permission management across systems
- **Activity Monitoring**: Comprehensive tracking of user actions and system interactions
- **Trust Scoring**: Dynamic reputation-based authorization
- **Secure Transactions**: Cryptographically verified state changes
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security through layered verification
- **Audit Logging**: Transparent and immutable activity records
- **Risk-Adaptive Permissions**: Dynamic access rights based on trust metrics

## Getting Started

### For System Administrators

1. Define granular roles and permissions
2. Configure trust score parameters
3. Set up multi-factor authentication rules
4. Monitor system-wide activities
5. Adjust access control strategies dynamically

### For Users

1. Register and establish initial trust profile
2. Authenticate using multi-factor methods
3. Request and manage access tokens
4. Interact with system under defined permissions
5. Build reputation through secure interactions
